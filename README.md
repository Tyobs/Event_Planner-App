This python project is basically focusing on event planner app

The GUI framework used in this project is TKinter a buld-in python module.

I have learned about it bofore coming to creation of it and including complex tasks of python operations and how to interact with the database.
The database used in this project is also a build in framework of python which is "SQLite", 
This program is using SQLite because of its simplisity in implementation and durability, as well as its efficiency.

this project is under construction and it is also an opens source, feel free to add ideas to make it more better.
